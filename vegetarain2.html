           <p>Sweet Potato Noodle Salad? <br>

            Yes. I’m fully serious. Sweet Potato Noodle Salad.<br>
            
            I have never loved a salad as much as I do in this moment – a salad whose <br> flavor profile (chipotle meets roasted corn meets cilantro) is at absolute <br>the center of my food happy place and whose entire texture and form <br> just mimics a big ol’ plate of pasta. WHAAAT. Now we’re talking, kids.<br> THIS is my kind of salad.<br>
            
            Can I just tell you something right now? Cooking has made me so happy <br> lately. I was kind of having a moment back a while ago where I didn’t <br> love cooking and I DID love takeout and it was kind of weird when it was <br> happening because I have a food blog. It’s my job to keep writing about <br> how much I love food, and of course I would never share recipes with you <br> that I didn’t love or actually make or actually eat for real in my true day <br> to day life, but it was sort of hard to find the soul of the whole cooking <br> gig for a second there. But it’s all good. Because honestly, I think the <br> change of pace (last week we order pizza, and now this week we make <br> fresh sweet potato noodle salads with chipotle dressing and have a slice <br> of homemade orange cake for dessert) is healthy in that sort of greasy-<br>pizza-is-good-for-your-soul-sometimes healthy way. You know what I <br> mean, right? I lost it, I defaulted to sushi and Thai curry and pizza for a <br> few weeks, and then I found it again.<br>
            
            Found it as in SWEET POTATO NOODLE SALAD found it. Ohhh my spicy <br> stars, this is so yummy.</p>

            <p>Sometimes you just need to get out of your routine and change things up <br> in order to sort of kick-start the system back into Thrive Mode, right? I’m <br> not the only one?<br>

                You know in your heart of hearts that you really want and love food and <br> cooking and/or whatever it might be for the rest of you people in the <br> world who don’t love food and cooking (I mean, I can’t even think of any <br> examples because what do people love if not food?) and then the crazy-<br>busy-stress-go-go-go of life happens and you find yourself sort of <br> dreading making meals and dragging your heels when you feel the pull <br> of the kitchen at 6pm. Or maybe you don’t feel the pull of the kitchen at <br> all. Which is alarming for someone who has always identified as loving <br> food and cooking, but also okay. A temporary break-up is okay.<br>
                
                For me, it’s totally a stress and anxiety thing, I think. Teaching the <br> workshops in our studio these last few months – it seriously made me <br> come alive in a new way. But when that part of me came alive, my food <br> brain shrunk back. And now the stress and chaos and anxiety of the <br> workshops has faded a little bit, and life has slowed down, and Bjork <br> went out of town for a few days (not that I WANTED him to be gone, but <br> sometimes just cooking whatever you want for your very own self helps <br> get things back in the groove, love u bb) and now I’m feeling like I have <br> my finger back on the pulse of my familiar old cooking heart. Which is <br> still, in fact, beating. ♡ <br>
                
                Yours probably is, too. I’m sure of it. And if you’re not sure, I’ll tell you <br> what will make you sure: <br>
                
                It starts with sweet potato noodles and ends with chipotle dressing and <br> cilantro and roasted corn and pepitas.</p>

              <p> You know those times when you are so excited about food that you just <br> HAVE to eat dinner at 5pm? Me either, barely, because most night we eat <br> dinner at 8pm.<br>

                But last night I got a slice of that Must Eat Dinner Now feeling when I got <br> home a little early from the studio and only had myself to cook for.<br> THESE ARE THE DAYS OF OUR LIVES, friends. Out came the wine and <br> cheese because apparently #SoloHappyHour is a thing? I highly <br> recommend. And just like that, with a big ol plate of Chipotle Sweet <br> Potato Noodle Salad, heavy on the cilantro, I became that person who <br> eats dinner right at the stroke of 5pm.<br>
                
                Now that I think of it, I guess it’s fitting since I’m turning 30 tomorrow <br> like ohmygosh I’m fine tho. So this is old age? Dinner at 5pm? I guess I <br> can deal.</p>

                       <li> Heat a little bit of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the sweet potato noodles and toss for a minute or two until softened. See notes.</li>

                    <h3>notes</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      <ul style="text-align: left;">
                      <li>If going sugar free is important to you, you can sub in chili powder to taste for the chipotle peppers.</li>
                      <li>For cooking the sweet potato noodles: you’ll notice a visible texture change when they’re ready – they just sort of relax into the pan instead of being so stiff. You don’t want them to be overly mushy but you also don’t want them to be rock hard and crunchy. Somewhere in between is perfect. For me, 5-ish minutes was about right.</li>
                      <li>For cooking the corn: this can do a number on your skillet, so make sure you’re using a high quality pan – either nonstick or a really well seasoned cast iron. The idea is to DRY roast them without oil or butter. They don’t get as browned and roasty if you have to put butter or oil in the pan. Also, the less frequently you stir, the more browned they’ll get. I used a nonstick and the bottom of the pan got a little brown but washed out very easily.

                    I so badly wanted this salad with Cotija cheese, but alas, we didn’t have <br> any and I was too lazy to drive out and get some. Please, someone,<br> PLEASE add a fat handful of that crumbly, salty Cotija to this and report <br> back. I might cry little tears of jealousy but I’ll be so happy for you.<br>
