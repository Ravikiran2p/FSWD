            Here they are! The meatballs of the hour – that are, actually, <br> not meatballs. <br>

            Because they are VEGETARIAN MEATBALLS! Made without beans (we’re <br> going rogue!) and made instead with cauliflower and brown rice and <br> quinoa.<br>
            
            I know, right? Sneak-ayyy.<br>
            
            As much as I love a good MEAT-ball meatball from time to time, today <br> we’re talking about these little vegetarian meatball nuggets of <br> powerhouse nutrition that are inspired from the (here comes the weird <br> zone) spicy cauliflower burgers I made and loved a few weeks ago.<br>
            
            The breakdown is that they’re made with cauliflower, brown rice,<br> quinoa, oat flour, eggs, and a nice big pinch of garlic and spices. And <br> they don’t require hours of prep. That’s it! It’s just simple,<br> straightforward, SUPER YUM plant-based goodness in the form of <br> vegetarian meatballs made weeknight-dinner-friendly, because real <br> food that matches real life is where it’s at.<br>
            
            And don’t we know it, guys? DON’T WE KNOW IT.<br>

            <p>
                There are a few things that I think we can all approve of with these<br> vegetarian meatballs:
                <ul style="display: table; margin: 0px auto;">
                      <li><span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;"> INGREDIENTS:</span> Basic, whole, wonderful –> Cauliflower // Brown<br> Rice // Quinoa // Garlic // Spices // Eggs // Oat Flour (which is <br> nothing more than just old fashioned oats crushed in your food <br> processor or blender). Also – no beans. Which is kind of nice, right? <br> since a lot of vegetarian meatballs are bean-heavy. All hail the<br> versatility of cauliflower!<br></li> 
                      <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">TIMING</span>30 minutes. The cauliflower is not high maintenance <br> here. Just a quick simmer in some hot water to soften it up, and <br> then as a bonus on being speedy, you can use those amazingly <br> convenient garlic brown rice quinoa packages from Seeds of <br> Change that you buy en masse at Costco – you know the ones, right? <br> – and then your cauli and your rice and everything else gets pulsed <br> around in our favorite appliance of all time THE FOOD PROCESSOR <br> in order to make the mixture. If you can enlist the help of a few<br> vegetarian meatball rollers (this is why people have children, <br> right?), you will have vegetarian meatball dinner on the table <br> AND vegetarian meatball stockpile built up in your fridge in no <br> time.<br></li>
                      <li><span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">ADAPTABILITY</span>Cook once, eat many times. This recipe makes a<br> million and a half meatless meatballs which means that you can use<br> them with many different sauces in many different recipes for<br> years to come. Er, no. Not years. But seriously – you will have a TON<br> of meatballs with this recipe, so start brainstorming serving and/or<br> sauce ideas (and please let the record state that I strongly<br> recommend LIFE CHANGING MASALA SAUCE).<br></li>

              <p>
                Yesterday I brought a freezer-ready bag of these to my sister since she<br> just had a new baby, and I was feeling a little vulnerable about being<br> the weird sister who brings non-meat meatballs as a food gift, but right<br> away when she saw them, she declared them to be a perfect finger food<br> for her two-year-old since he loves things he can hold and dip and<br> nibble on at his own slow-eating pace. UM WHAT. As a non-mom, I didn’t<br> even think of that genius, but how cute is the visual of your favorite two-<br>year-old dipping a veggie meatball made with cauliflower and quinoa<br> and brown rice into ketchup or marinara or ranch (not above it) or – for<br> the foodie toddlers out there – a little spicy masala sauce? It’s like a<br> chicken nugget meets veggie burger in kid-friendly size.<br>

                I’m sure that someday, when Bjork and I have kids, they will be foodie</br> kids who love to dip veggie nuggets in masala sauce, right?<br>
                
                That sort of thing has to be genetic? PLEASE SAY YES<br>
              </p>
              <br>

              <br>
              <p>
                I cannot get enough of these vegetarian meatballs with a few gallons of<br> the life-changing 30 minute masala sauce, but I’d be okay if you did just<br> about anything with these. They are begging for some creative serving<br> combinations and a good drench in a delicious sauce, and as we know,<br> sauce is life.<br>

                Go get em, dinner-makers!<br>

                    <ul style="text-align: left;">
                        <li>3 cups cauliflower florets (roughly 1 head of cauliflower)</li>
                        <li>3 cups cooked quinoa and/or brown rice (see notes)</li>
                        <li>3/4 cups of a “dry ingredient” like oat flour, almond meal, breadcrumbs, etc.</li>
                        <li>4 eggs</li>
                        <li>1 heaping tablespoon spices (chili powder, paprika, and/or cumin will work)</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                        <li>enough olive oil to cover the bottom of a frying pan with a thin coating</li>

                    <p class="card-text">
                      <ol style="text-align: left;">
                        <li> <span style="color: rgb(18, 15, 19); font-weight: bold;"> Cauliflower</span> Cook the cauliflower florets in a pot of boiling water for about 5 minutes, till fork-tender. Drain well.</li>
                         <li> <span style="color: rgb(18, 15, 19); font-weight: bold;"> Mix</span> Pulse the quinoa and cauliflower through a food processor until semi-smooth (see pictures for texture). Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl and combine with all other ingredients. Stir until everything is incorporated. Roll into small balls (about one heaping tablespoon per ball was best for me).</li>
                          <li> <span style="color: rgb(18, 15, 19); font-weight: bold;">Cook</span> Heat a thin layer of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat – add the balls and cook for a few minutes on each side – they will need to be gently turned every so often to get browned all the way around. Serve with yummy sauces, salads, bowls, or freeze for later!</li>
                      </ol>
                    </p>
                    <h3>notes</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      <ul style="text-align: left;">
                      <li>I used Seeds of Change pre-cooked garlic brown rice and quinoa for this recipe (2 packets = about 3 cups). Since this has garlic flavor already in the mix, if you are using your own pre-cooked quinoa and/or brown rice, make sure to add some minced garlic or garlic powder.</li>

                       <li> If the mixture doesn’t stick together in a ball when gently pressed, add about 1/3 of the mixture back into the food processor and pulse until it’s more the consistency of hummus. That should help it hold together. If that still isn’t enough, just add a little more of your “dry ingredient” till you get a consistency that you can gently roll between your hands to form ball shapes.</li>
                        
                       <li>Nutrition facts are for 1/12th of this recipe, so just take your total # of meatballs and divide them into 12 servings – the exact number of meatballs per serving depends on how big you make the meatballs.</li>
